# Using Graph Stores

## `NebulaGraphStore`

We support a `NebulaGraphStore` integration, for persisting graphs directly in Nebula! Furthermore, you can generate cypher queries and return natural language responses for your Nebula graphs using the `KnowledgeGraphQueryEngine`.

## `KuzuGraphStore`

We support a `KuzuGraphStore` integration, for persisting graphs directly in [Kuzu](https://kuzudb.com).
