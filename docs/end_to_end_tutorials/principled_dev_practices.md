# Principled Development Practices

In order to develop your application, it can help to implement some principled development practices.

Here we provide some general guidance to help you better anticipate the challenges and concerns you may encounter as you develop your LLM application.

Here are the main pillars of principled development of LLM and RAG applications.
- The first pillar is **observability**: setting up initial tools to observe, debug your system and evaluate it on ad-hoc examples.
- The next pillar is **evaluation**: being able to evaluate different components of your system so that you can experiment and improve it in a more systematic fashion.
- The last pillar is **monitoring**: after the application is deployed, we want to continuously monitor and test that it is performing well in production.
