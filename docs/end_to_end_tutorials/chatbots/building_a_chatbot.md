# ðŸ’¬ðŸ¤– How to Build a Chatbot

LlamaIndex serves as a bridge between your data and Language Learning Models (LLMs), providing a toolkit that enables you to establish a query interface around your data for a variety of tasks, such as question-answering and summarization.

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through building a context-augmented chatbot using a [Data Agent](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/stable/core_modules/agent_modules/agents/root.html). This agent, powered by LLMs, is capable of intelligently executing tasks over your data. The end result is a chatbot agent equipped with a robust set of data interface tools provided by LlamaIndex to answer queries about your data.

**Note**: This tutorial builds upon initial work on creating a query interface over SEC 10-K filings - [check it out here](https://medium.com/@jerryjliu98/how-unstructured-and-llamaindex-can-help-bring-the-power-of-llms-to-your-own-data-3657d063e30d).

### Context

In this guide, weâ€™ll build a "10-K Chatbot" that uses raw UBER 10-K HTML filings from Dropbox. Users can interact with the chatbot to ask questions related to the 10-K filings.

### Preparation

```python
import os
import openai

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."
openai.api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]

import nest_asyncio

nest_asyncio.apply()
```

### Ingest Data

Let's first download the raw 10-k files, from 2019-2022.

```python
# NOTE: the code examples assume you're operating within a Jupyter notebook.
# download files
!mkdir data
!wget "https://www.dropbox.com/s/948jr9cfs7fgj99/UBER.zip?dl=1" -O data/UBER.zip
!unzip data/UBER.zip -d data
```

To parse the HTML files into formatted text, we use the [Unstructured](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured) library. Thanks to [LlamaHub](https://llamahub.ai/), we can directly integrate with Unstructured, allowing conversion of any text into a Document format that LlamaIndex can ingest.

First we install the necessary packages:

```python
!pip install llama-hub unstructured
```

Then we can use the `UnstructuredReader` to parse the HTML files into a list of `Document` objects.

```python
from llama_hub.file.unstructured.base import UnstructuredReader
from pathlib import Path

years = [2022, 2021, 2020, 2019]

loader = UnstructuredReader()
doc_set = {}
all_docs = []
for year in years:
    year_docs = loader.load_data(
        file=Path(f"./data/UBER/UBER_{year}.html"), split_documents=False
    )
    # insert year metadata into each year
    for d in year_docs:
        d.metadata = {"year": year}
    doc_set[year] = year_docs
    all_docs.extend(year_docs)
```

### Setting up Vector Indices for each year

We first setup a vector index for each year. Each vector index allows us
to ask questions about the 10-K filing of a given year.

We build each index and save it to disk.

```python
# initialize simple vector indices
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, ServiceContext, StorageContext

index_set = {}
service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(chunk_size=512)
for year in years:
    storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults()
    cur_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(
        doc_set[year],
        service_context=service_context,
        storage_context=storage_context,
    )
    index_set[year] = cur_index
    storage_context.persist(persist_dir=f"./storage/{year}")
```

To load an index from disk, do the following

```python
# Load indices from disk
from llama_index import load_index_from_storage

index_set = {}
for year in years:
    storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(persist_dir=f"./storage/{year}")
    cur_index = load_index_from_storage(
        storage_context, service_context=service_context
    )
    index_set[year] = cur_index
```

### Setting up a Sub Question Query Engine to Synthesize Answers Across 10-K Filings

Since we have access to documents of 4 years, we may not only want to ask questions regarding the 10-K document of a given year, but ask questions that require analysis over all 10-K filings.

To address this, we can use a [Sub Question Query Engine](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/query_engine/sub_question_query_engine.html). It decomposes a query into subqueries, each answered by an individual vector index, and synthesizes the results to answer the overall query.

LlamaIndex provides some wrappers around indices (and query engines) so that they can be used by query engines and agents. First we define a `QueryEngineTool` for each vector index.
Each tool has a name and a description; these are what the LLM agent sees to decide which tool to choose.

```python
from llama_index.tools import QueryEngineTool, ToolMetadata

individual_query_engine_tools = [
    QueryEngineTool(
        query_engine=index_set[year].as_query_engine(),
        metadata=ToolMetadata(
            name=f"vector_index_{year}",
            description=f"useful for when you want to answer queries about the {year} SEC 10-K for Uber",
        ),
    )
    for year in years
]
```

Now we can create the Sub Question Query Engine, which will allow us to synthesize answers across the 10-K filings. We pass in the `individual_query_engine_tools` we defined above, as well as a `service_context` that will be used to run the subqueries.

```python
from llama_index.query_engine import SubQuestionQueryEngine

query_engine = SubQuestionQueryEngine.from_defaults(
    query_engine_tools=individual_query_engine_tools,
    service_context=service_context,
)
```

### Setting up the Chatbot Agent

We use a LlamaIndex Data Agent to setup the outer chatbot agent, which has access to a set of Tools. Specifically, we will use an OpenAIAgent, that takes advantage of OpenAI API function calling. We want to use the separate Tools we defined previously for each index (corresponding to a given year), as well as a tool for the sub question query engine we defined above.

First we define a `QueryEngineTool` for the sub question query engine:

```python
query_engine_tool = QueryEngineTool(
    query_engine=query_engine,
    metadata=ToolMetadata(
        name="sub_question_query_engine",
        description="useful for when you want to answer queries that require analyzing multiple SEC 10-K documents for Uber",
    ),
)
```

Then, we combine the Tools we defined above into a single list of tools for the agent:

```python
tools = individual_query_engine_tools + [query_engine_tool]
```

Finally, we call `OpenAIAgent.from_tools` to create the agent, passing in the list of tools we defined above.

```python
from llama_index.agent import OpenAIAgent

agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(tools, verbose=True)
```

### Testing the Agent

We can now test the agent with various queries.

If we test it with a simple "hello" query, the agent does not use any Tools.

```python
response = agent.chat("hi, i am bob")
print(str(response))
```

```
Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?
```

If we test it with a query regarding the 10-k of a given year, the agent will use
the relevant vector index Tool.

```python
response = agent.chat("What were some of the biggest risk factors in 2020 for Uber?")
print(str(response))
```

```

```

Finally, if we test it with a query to compare/contrast risk factors across years,
the agent will use the Sub Question Query Engine Tool.

```python
cross_query_str = "Compare/contrast the risk factors described in the Uber 10-K across years. Give answer in bullet points."

response = agent.chat(cross_query_str)
print(str(response))
```

Got output: The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect parts of our business. Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors. The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability. If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.

### Setting up the Chatbot Loop

Now that we have the chatbot setup, it only takes a few more steps to setup a basic interactive loop to chat with our SEC-augmented chatbot!

```python
agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(tools)  # verbose=False by default

while True:
    text_input = input("User: ")
    if text_input == "exit":
        break
    response = agent.chat(text_input)
    print(f"Agent: {response}")
```

Here's an example of the loop in action:

```
User:  What were some of the legal proceedings against Uber in 2022?
Agent: In 2022, Uber faced several legal proceedings. Some of the notable ones include:

1. Petition against Proposition 22: A petition was filed in California alleging that Proposition 22, which classifies app-based drivers as independent contractors, is unconstitutional.

2. Lawsuit by Massachusetts Attorney General: The Massachusetts Attorney General filed a lawsuit against Uber, claiming that drivers should be classified as employees and entitled to protections under wage and labor laws.

3. Allegations by New York Attorney General: The New York Attorney General made allegations against Uber regarding the misclassification of drivers and related employment violations.

4. Swiss social security rulings: Swiss social security rulings classified Uber drivers as employees, which could have implications for Uber's operations in Switzerland.

5. Class action lawsuits in Australia: Uber faced class action lawsuits in Australia, with allegations that the company conspired to harm participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries.

It's important to note that the outcomes of these legal proceedings are uncertain and may vary.
