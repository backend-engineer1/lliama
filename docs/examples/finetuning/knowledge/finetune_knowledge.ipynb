Additionally, Llama 2 employs a default ToxiGen classifier tuned on RoBERTa to measure the toxicity of its generations.

       "35  Llama 2 has taken measures to mitigate the generation of harmful, offensive, or biased content. One of the measures is the use of the ToxiGen dataset, which contains implicitly toxic and benign sentences mentioning minority groups. Llama 2 uses a revised version of this dataset to reduce noise and filter out prompts for which annotators disagree on the target demographic group. Additionally, Llama 2 employs a default ToxiGen classifier tuned on RoBERTa to measure the toxicity of its generations. Furthermore, Llama 2 conducts a sentiment analysis using the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) to evaluate the sentiments conveyed by the combination of prompt prefix and model generation. These measures help in analyzing and addressing the potential biases and toxicity in the generated content.   \n",

However, it's common for AI models like Llama 2 to incorporate various strategies to ensure responsible use. These may include the use of reinforcement learning from human feedback to reduce harmful and untruthful outputs, and the use of guidelines for human reviewers during the fine-tuning process to avoid potential biases. Additionally, efforts are often made to improve the default behavior of the system, and provide users with customization options to define the AI's values within broad bounds.
