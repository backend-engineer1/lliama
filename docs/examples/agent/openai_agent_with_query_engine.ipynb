      "Got output: \n",
      "Uber's revenue growth in 2021 was 57%.\n",
      "========================\n",
      "Assistant: In 2021, Lyft's revenue grew by 36% compared to the previous year, while Uber's revenue growth was higher at 57%. This indicates that Uber experienced a faster rate of revenue growth than Lyft in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "The higher revenue growth for Uber can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, Uber has a larger market presence and operates in more countries and cities compared to Lyft. This broader reach allows Uber to capture a larger customer base and generate more revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, Uber has diversified its business beyond ride-hailing services. The company has expanded into food delivery with Uber Eats, which has experienced significant growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. This diversification has helped Uber generate additional revenue streams and mitigate the impact of fluctuations in the ride-hailing market.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, Lyft's revenue growth, although lower than Uber's, is still significant. Lyft has been focusing on improving its market share in the United States and has made efforts to expand its presence in suburban and rural areas. This targeted approach has helped Lyft attract new customers and increase its revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, both Lyft and Uber have experienced strong revenue growth in 2021. However, Uber's larger market presence and diversification into other services have contributed to its higher revenue growth rate compared to Lyft. It will be interesting to see how these companies continue to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions in the future.\n",
