    "# OpenAI Agent Query Planning\n",
    "In this demo, we explore adding a `QueryPlanTool` to an `OpenAIAgent`. This effectively enables the agent\n",
    "to do advanced query planning, all through a single tool! \n",
    "\n",
    "The `QueryPlanTool` is designed to work well with the OpenAI Function API. The tool takes in a set of other tools as input.\n",
    "The tool function signature contains of a QueryPlan Pydantic object, which can in turn contain a DAG of QueryNode objects defining a compute graph.\n",
    "The agent is responsible for defining this graph through the function signature when calling the tool. The tool itself executes the DAG over any corresponding tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setting we use a familiar example: Uber 10Q filings in March, June, and September of 2022."
