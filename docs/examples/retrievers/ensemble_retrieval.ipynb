    "Oftentimes when building a RAG applications there are many retreival parameters/strategies to decide from (from chunk size to vector vs. keyword vs. hybrid search, for instance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thought: what if we could try a bunch of strategies at once, and have any AI/reranker/LLM prune the results?\n",
    "\n",
    "This achieves two purposes:\n",
    "- Better (albeit more costly) retrieved results by pooling results from multiple strategies, assuming the reranker is good\n",
    "- A way to benchmark different retrieval strategies against each other (w.r.t reranker)\n",
