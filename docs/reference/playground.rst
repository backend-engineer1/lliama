Playground
=================
Playground is a way to automatically test your data (i.e. documents) across a diverse combination of indices, models, embeddings, modes, etc. to decide which ones are best for your purposes. More options will continue to be added.

For each combination, you'll be able to compare the results for any query and compare the answers, latency, tokens used, and so on.

You may initialize a Playground with a list of pre-built indices, or initialize one from a list of Documents using the preset indices.
