Querying an Index
=================

This doc shows the classes that are used to query indices.
We first show index-specific query subclasses.
We then show how to define a query config in order to recursively query
multiple indices that are `composed </how_to/composability.html>`_ together.
We then show the base query class, which contains parameters that are shared
among all queries.

This section shows how to define a query config in order to recursively query
