# Using with Langchain ðŸ¦œðŸ”—

We provide a demo notebook showing how you can use GPT Index with Langchain.
We provide the following examples:
- Using GPT Index as a callable tool with a Langchain agent
- Using GPT Index as a memory module; this allows you to insert arbitrary amounts of conversation history with a Langchain chatbot!
