# Using with Langchain ðŸ¦œðŸ”—

We provide a demo notebook showing how you can use LlamaIndex with Langchain.
We provide the following examples:
- Using LlamaIndex as a callable tool with a Langchain agent
- Using LlamaIndex as a memory module; this allows you to insert arbitrary amounts of conversation history with a Langchain chatbot!
