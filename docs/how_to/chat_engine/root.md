# ðŸ’¬ Chat Engine

## Concept
Chat engine is a high-level interface for having a conversation with your data
(multiple back-and-forth instead of a single question & answer).
Think ChatGPT, but augmented with your knowledge base.  

Conceptually, it is a **stateful** analogy of a [Query Engine](/how_to/query_engine/root.md). 
By keeping track of the conversation history, it can answer questions with past context in mind.  


> If you want to ask standalone question over your data (i.e. without keeping track of conversation history), use [Query Engine](/how_to/query_engine/root.md) instead.  

## Usage Pattern
Get started with:
```python
chat_engine = index.as_chat_engine()
response = chat_engine.chat("Tell me a joke.")
```
