He also wrote simple games, a program to predict how high his model rockets would fly, and a word processor. He studied philosophy in college, but switched to AI and taught himself Lisp. He wrote a book about Lisp hacking and reverse-engineered SHRDLU. He also took art classes at Harvard and applied to art schools, but was disappointed by the lack of teaching and learning in the painting department at the Accademia. He also had experience with 19th century studio painting conventions, such as having a little stove fed with kindling and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible.</b>"

After finishing Bel, he wrote a bunch of essays and started to think about other things he could work on. He wrote an essay for himself to answer the question of how to choose what to work on, and then wrote a more detailed version for others to read. He also reflected on the exponential growth of commodity processors and the tight coupling of money and coolness in the art world. He also found a rent-stabilized apartment in New York, which was much cheaper than market price. Finally, he worked on software that could be launched as soon as it was done.</b>"
